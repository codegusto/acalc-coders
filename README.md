This cluster for ACALC will introduce the fundamentals of computer programming using the Python programming language.  The details of this course come from a book titled "Teach Your Kids to Code" by Bryson Payne.  

The examples covered by this course will be available on this GitHub source code repository and can be used at home.  Below are some steps to following to download, install, and test Python on a home computer/laptop running Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X.
 
1) Navigate a browser to https://www.python.org/downloads/
 
2) Click the yellow button that says ‘Download Python 3.7.0’
 
3) Find the downloaded file on the machine (its probably in the ‘Downloads’ folder) and double click it to run and install Python and the IDLE editor. IDLE is the program we’ll use to type and run our Python programs. 
 
4) After installed, search for the IDLE program on the computer and run it. You should see a text-based command window which is the Python Shell, which lets users enter commands or lines of code. 
 
5) Within the IDLE Python Shell at the prompt (it looks like this: >>>) type the following:
 
print(“Hello, world!”)

6) Press Enter or Return on the keyboard. You should see the Python Shell respond by printing the text Hello, world!
 
That’s it!
